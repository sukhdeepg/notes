### Thread-Safe In-Memory Cache
This design creates a cache for threat data. It needs to handle many "reader" tasks looking up data and occasional "writer" tasks updating it, all without conflict. The key challenge is to allow multiple readers at the same time for performance while ensuring writers have exclusive access.  
For this, a Read-Write Lock is ideal, but `asyncio` doesn't have a built-in one. We can simulate it for clarity or use a simple `asyncio.Lock` for demonstration. Let's use `asyncio.Lock` for simplicity and comment on where a Read-Write lock would be better.

```python
import asyncio
import random
from collections import OrderedDict

class ThreatCache:
    """
    A thread-safe, in-memory cache with an LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy.
    """
    def __init__(self, capacity: int = 5):
        # The cache itself. OrderedDict remembers the insertion order,
        # which is perfect for an LRU eviction strategy.
        self._cache = OrderedDict()
        self.capacity = capacity
        
        # The Lock
        # This single lock protects the cache. Any time a task wants to read
        # or write to self._cache, it must first acquire this lock.
        #
        # **IDEAL SCENARIO**: A Read-Write lock would be better. It would allow
        # multiple readers to access the cache simultaneously, only locking
        # exclusively when a writer needs access. This improves performance
        # on a read-heavy system. We use a simple lock here for clarity.
        self._lock = asyncio.Lock()

    async def get(self, key: str) -> str | None:
        """

            # it was just used. The item at the beginning will be the least

            # which is the least recently used.
